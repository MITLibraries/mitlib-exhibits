# Theme requirements

* Implement MIT Libraries' branding and usability
  - Mobile-first, responsive
  - Layer-based UI layout
    - Black top bar with links to platform, Libraries, and MIT
    - Minimal footer with only required links (accessibility, privacy, permissions)
  - Use of MIT Libraries' font stack (Neue Haas Grotesk, Arial, Helvetica), color scheme, and logo marks
  - Breadcrumb element to locate the user within the Libraries' discovery environment
* Support controllable customization on a per-exhibit basis
  - Banner image
  - Some number of color variations based on Pentagram color palette (see Union college for example)
* Anticipated exhibit content
  - Primary media will be raster images, but some examples already of video files (YouTube) and PDF documents.
  - Uncertain whether audio file support will be needed
* Templates for:
  - Curated page content
  - Item-sets of cataloged records
  - Lists of items (separate from item-sets)
  - Individual cataloged item (primarily images, but other types possible)
  - Media asset within an item?

## Open questions

* Best practices for creating cataloged records (relationship between items and their media, etc) are still being defined

* Should there be support for modal dialogs when clicking on an item representation on a page?

* How to visually establish the different-but-related status between the Exhibits platform and other Libraries platforms (WordPress, Libguides, etc)

* Why do records in production reference the sandbox platform?
